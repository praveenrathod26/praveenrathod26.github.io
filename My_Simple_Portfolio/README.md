## How does this work?
This website template uses CSS & JS to hide and show different parts of index.html and uses Github Pages to render the website from the gh-pages branch.

## Things to try
- Edit index.html and change the title of the page
- Edit index.html and change the content displayed in home, about, and contact.
- Edit index.html and change the content in the footer region.
- Replace logo.jpg and background.jpg with your own images.
- Update the metadata in the header portion of index.html (this is used by search engines and browsers).
- Edit style.css and change the link color and font style.
